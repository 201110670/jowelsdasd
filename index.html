						<h1>Basic Tree Planting</h1>

		<div data-role="content">
		
					<center>
					<img src="images/1.jpg" height="100%" width="100%" />
					<p align="justify" style="color:white">1.Select the right time of year for planting the tree. If you plant your tree at the wrong time of year it's going to be less likely to survive and grow. Do not plant in late spring or summer because the heat will stress the plant and may cause it to die. Of course, all this depends on the type of plant, because different plants have different needs.</p><p  align="justify" style="color:white">A.
In general, April and May are the best times to plant in the Northern hemisphere, because the tree has all summer to grow and get accustomed to its new abode. Otherwise, September and October are your best bet. It tends to be cooler and rainier and the trees are getting ready for hibernation.</p>
<p align="justify" style="color:white">B.Certain trees don't do well if planted in the fall, like oaks (nut trees) and birches. Container trees tend to do better if planted in the fall than trees in burlap or trees that are baled, because these tend to go into transplanting shock in the fall.</p>
					<img src="images/2.jpg" height="100%" width="100%" />
					<p align="justify" style="color:white">2.Check to see if there are any local requirements about digging. These types of requirements tend to concern digging deep holes near telephone and other cables (for example, in urban areas). You'll need to make sure that you know where these cables and systems before you dig..</p>
					<img src="images/3.jpg" height="100%" width="100%" />
					<p align="justify" style="color:white">3.Choose a suitable tree for the region, climate, and space. Trees native to your area tend to do well, and you won't be introducing a potential invasive plant species. It will be easier to care for a tree that is already native to the area.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="color:white">-Research local cultivars of species native to your area. If you are willing plant a non-native species, consider carefully why and whether it's actually a good idea to do so, since non-native trees can be invasive and damaging to the ecosystem of your area.</p>
					<img src="images/4.jpg" height="100%" width="100%" />
					<p align="justify" style="color:white">4.Prepare the hole. Take a suitable shovel and dig a hole that is 4-5 times the width of the root ball, more than enough so it will fit, and give room for the fresh roots to grow without stress. This lets the roots ease in more easily and begin to grow outwards into the soil. No need to cut off the wire root basket if there is one, the roots will grow through and it will prevent damage to the root ball during planting.</p>
<p align="justify" style="color:white">A.Try to dig the hole with a small "pedestal" of dirt in the center of the hole where the tree will rest. The hole should be a little deeper around the edges but there should be a pedestal of dirt in the center where the root ball sits. This pedestal prevents the root ball from sitting continuously in water. Any excess water will naturally flow to the deeper areas of the hole around the edges where the roots can drink from if needed.</p>
<p align="justify" style="color:white">B.Having a pedestal in the center of the hole is very important since one of the major reasons why trees die is "drowning," meaning the tree is getting too much water and the root ball is sitting in a pool of water. The point where the tree comes out of the ground should be slightly higher than the ground around it. Slightly higher means 1/4 to 1/2 inch. This prevents water from collecting next to the base of the trunk which causes the tree to rot.</p>
<p align="justify" style="color:white">C.Use the garden cultivator to loosen the dirt all around the hole to make it easier for the roots to spread.</p>
					<p align="justify" style="color:white">5.Prepare the tree for planting. You need to do this to make sure that you're planting your tree properly and so that it will survive. The process is slightly different for a small tree and a large tree.</p>
<p align="justify" style="color:white">A.If it is a small tree, then you can turn it upside down gently to get it out of the pot. You could also cut some plastic containers to remove them.</p>
<p align="justify" style="color:white">B.If the tree is larger and has a net or a hessian or rope bag, you might need to use large scissors or a sharp knife to cut through the packaging. Avoid handling the tree with the burlap off. Put it in the hole, then cut the burlap and rope from around the trunk of the tree, leaving the wire basket. The goal is to keep as much dirt around the roots as possible; moving the tree more than absolutely necessary can easily cause air to get to the roots and dry them out, even inside the root ball.</p>
<p align="justify" style="color:white">C.Don't leave a tree's roots out of its container or burlap for too long. Especially in sun and wind, it could dry out and damage the roots.</p>
					<p align="justify" style="color:white">6.Use a seed for planting. Follow this step only if you're going to be growing a tree from a seed. Growing a tree from a seed means germinating the seed, planting it at the appropriate time and taking close care of it. This way takes a bit longer than planting by transplanting a tree from a container.</p>
<p align="justify" style="color:white">A.To germinate a seed you may have to use scarification, which means that you break the seed coat and allow moisture to penetrate so that the plant embryo can begin germinating. You can also use the cold stratification process which means that you mimic the over-wintering process and expose the seed to cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p align="justify" style="color:white">B.Once the seeds have germinated in a normal fashion, plant them in an individual container or a seed tray. The seeds for the different trees will be different, so follow the instructions accordingly for each. When they've germinated, move them to a brighter location and make sure that they are well ventilated.</p>
<p align="justify" style="color:white">C.Remember, different tree seeds will grow differently so you'll need to make sure that you follow the instructions for each individual tree. An apple tree will grow differently than a cherry tree or a pine tree.</p>

					<p align="justify" style="color:white">Industrial arts began as early as prehistoric times when human beings first developed tools, according to the Journal of Technology Education. Formal instruction for industrial arts arose during the late 1800s and consisted of manual training for trades in manufacturing. Industrial arts education became popular in the 1900s as an alternative for students seeking to learn a trade. Known as vocational school, the purpose of industrial arts classes included teaching students specific skills such as automobile repair or furniture design. Today, the meaning of industrial arts encompasses a wide variety of technical specialties.</p>

						<h1>BENEFITS AND DRAWBACKS OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP</h1>

		<div data-role="content">
		
					<center>
					<p align="justify" style="color:white">Choosing to create a new business, or even to purchase an existing one, is a decision that has a far-reaching impact. Long hours, poor pay, and an unclear future are only three of the challenges a budding entrepreneur must face. And, of course, losing everything one invests in a business is a very real risk. In fact, while 885,416 new employer firms were created in 1997, as reported by the U.S. Department of Labor, 857,073 businesses were terminated during the same year, with 53,826 of these being bankruptcies and 83,384 being failures. Failures and bankruptcies are business closures that occur while the business owes debts.</p>

						<h1>BUSINESS PLAN</h1>

		<div data-role="content">
		
					<center>
					<p align="justify" style="color:white">Planning is a key ingredient in the success of an entrepreneur. A business plan helps to guide the decision making needed to operate a business. The first decision is to choose what sort of business to own. The business may be:</p>

<p align="justify" style="color:white">A retail business that markets a tangible product (such as clothing, houses, food)
A wholesale business that acquires goods from a producer and distributes requested quantities to retailers
A service business that offers an intangible product (such as insurance, haircuts, consultant services, construction, financial services)
A manufacturing business that produces a product
Of course, a business may perform more than one of these functions.</p>

						<h1>Marketing Plan</h1>
		</div>
		
		<div data-role="content">
		
					<center>
					<p align="justify" style="color:white">Marketing is a process in which the decisions of the business are based upon the goals of the organization. One of these goals is usually that of satisfying the needs and wants of potential customers or a target market. Potential customers can be divided into specific market segments that represent groups based on specified characteristics. For example, a business may strive to serve those in their late teens and early twenties who live primarily in large cities. Narrowing the segment even further, the business may offer goods or services for those interested specifically in sports—both as active players and as spectators or fans. Thus the business may sell athletic shoes and clothing, sports equipment, and how-to books. The owner(s) would locate this business in an area with a large number of people in that age group. Other factors to consider when defining a target market include such demographic factors as income level, sex, marital status, and ethnic group, and such geographic factors as climate and region of the country.</p>

		<div data-role="header" >
						<h1>Product</h1>
		</div>
		
		<div data-role="content">
		
					<center>
					<p align="justify" style="color:white">The product is the goods and/or services offered by the business. A travel agent may offer the service of arranging any type of trip to anywhere in the world or may specialize specifically in cruises. Choosing products is dependent on the market segment the business intends to serve. Other considerations include the amount of physical space available for storing the product, the amount of funds needed to purchase the product from the wholesaler or manufacturer, and the profitability potential of offering the product. Another important consideration is the product's life cycle. A life cycle has four sections: introduction, growth, maturity, and decline. When a new product is introduced to the market, it is in the introduction phase. Over time, it may grow in popularity and sales, reaching a point of maturity. Maturity is then followed by decline. An entrepreneur must be careful to avoid offering products or services that are in decline. That is one of the reasons for continually monitoring the sales of products and adjusting the product mix to reflect such changes in the product life cycle.</p>

						<h1>Place</h1>

		<div data-role="content">
		
					<center>
					<p align="justify" style="color:white">Another factor in the marketing mix is place. Marketers often say that the success of a business is dependent upon "location … location … location." Choosing the location of the business is an important decision that must take into consideration such factors as the chosen target market, traffic patterns, parking availability, population trends, competitive businesses, rental costs, and other expenses. The place function also includes business activities that involve physical distribution, such as transporting goods, handling the goods, storing the goods, and keeping track of the goods (inventory).</p>

		<div data-role="content">
		
					<center>
					<p align="justify" style="color:white">The American Heritage Dictionary defines cosmetology as "the study or art in cosmetics and their use". They define cosmetics as "serving to beautify the body and improve the appearance of a physical feature." Cosmetology is a broad term that is used to encompass a wide range of beauty mediums, including hair, skin, nails, and makeup. Schools that offer cosmetology degrees have crafted their curricula to address all of these categories. </p>

					<p align="justify" style="color:white">The ability to adapt your new found skills to different people. Everyperson will present a unique challenge to the cosmetologist as each individual will have a different combination of hair type, face type, nail type, etc. This is one of the greatest challenges in cosmetology careers. For instance, the kind of blush work a makeup artist performs will depend on the shape of the client's face: a round face will require a fair amount of contouring while someone with well-defined cheekbones will only need to highlight this feature</p>

		<div data-role="content">
		
					<center>
					<img src="images/aa.jpg" height="100%" width="100%" />
					<p align="justify" style="color:white">1.The best time to apply nail polish is when they are completely dry. If you apply nail polish while your nails are wet, or right before they will become wet, they will be prone to chipping. Start off by filing your nails in the desired shape. Buffing them also helps to smooth the nail base and makes it easier to apply nail polish.</p>
					<img src="images/bb.jpg" height="100%" width="100%" />
					<p align="justify" style="color:white">2.Start by applying a clear base coat. First, take a good amount of polish on the brush and apply a coat right in the centre of the nail. Take some more polish on the brush and apply coats on the two sides of the nails. Make sure that the entire nail is covered in these 3 swipes. Never keep on repainting the nail, it thickens the polish and you may smudge it. Let the base coat dry completely.</p>
					<img src="images/cc.jpg" height="100%" width="100%" />
					<p align="justify" style="color:white">3.After the base coat is done - apply the colour of your choice to the nail. Apply it in similar fashion, first in the centre of the nail and then on the sides. Once all your nails are done, wait for it to dry. If the colour that you've applied is really light, it needs another coat. So apply the second coat and make sure it dries.</p>
					<img src="images/dd.jpg" height="100%" width="100%" />
					<p align="justify" style="color:white">4.Apply a top coat and let it dry. If you want to, you can apply a fast-setting top coat (available in beauty stores) and make sure it sets really soon. If you don't have a top coat, dip your fingers in ice cold water. This sets the nails polish and gives it a nice shine.</p>
					<img src="images/ee.jpg" height="100%" width="100%" />
					<p align="justify" style="color:white">5.If you've gotten some nail polish on your cuticles, fingers or anywhere else, don't worry. Dip a Q-tip in some nail polish remover and gently remove the extra polish. This will make sure your nail polish job is clean and neat.</p>
					<img src="images/ff.jpg" height="100%" width="100%" />
					<p align="justify" style="color:white">6.After you are completely done with applying nail polish, you can dip your nails in cold water, this helps a lot because it hardens the nail polish and stays neat. If you would like to take a shower after applying nail polish make sure it is dry and be sure NOT to take a hot shower, this will melt the nail polish.</p>

						<h1>Basic Steps in Hair Cutting</h1>
		</div>
		
		<div data-role="content">
		
					<center>
					<p align="justify" style="color:white">1.Know how to do the seven section parting technique. Doing this will prepare the hair for when you cut and style it, and will make it a lot easier to keep the ends even. You should part the hair so that there are sections on the top, right crown, left crown, right side, left side, right nape, and left nape. Fasten each section with a hair clip.</p>
					<img src="images/11.jpg" height="100%" width="100%" />
					<p align="justify" style="color:white">2.Master the blunt cut. Use the seven section parting technique that you learned above. Comb and then cut each section at the front of your face. Make sure to set cutting guides at the back and front, and then follow them around the head for each section. Keep the scissor blade flat while cutting.</p>
					<p align="justify" style="color:white">3Cross-check your work. After cutting hair, make sure to cross-check it before letting your client leave the salon. Comb through every section of hair thoroughly and make sure that the hair is level and even. Use caution if you've cut the hair in a very angled style, as this will make cross-checking a bit harder.</p>
					<img src="images/22.jpg" height="100%" width="100%" />
					<p align="justify" style="color:white">4.Layer hair. Wash the hair so that it's wet and clean. Comb it out so that there's no knots. Gather a selected amount of hair and twist it into a tight spiral. Cut off the amount of hair that you want to cut straight across, then release the spiral.</p>
					<p align="justify" style="color:white">5.Don't let your foils bleed. "Bleeding" in hairstyling is when the product is applied higher than the foils, causing stains on areas of the hair that shouldn't be highlighted. To avoid bleeding, make sure you have clean and clear sections, the foils are folded properly, and avoid applying product at the very top of your foils. Instead, leave a small space before applying product. Also, don't goop on the product. Less is more when doing foils.</p>
					<img src="images/33.jpg" height="100%" width="100%" />
					<p align="justify" style="color:white">6.Know how to trim bangs. Pin up or section the hair that you don't want to trim. Divide the bangs using a fine tooth comb. Cut the hair slowly at a 45-degree angle to the desired length. Make sure that your bangs are dry so that you will know what the real length will be.</p>		
					<p align="justify" style="color:white">7.Master the A-line cut. The a-line is when the hair is angled in a bob so that it's longer in the front and shorter in the back. Use the seven-section method, then cut the sections at the back shorter than the ones at the front, gradually leaving the hair longer each time while you work towards the front of the head.</p>
